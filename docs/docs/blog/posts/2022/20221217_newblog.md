description: Looks like Santa was extra special this year, and brought us a new gadget, a 3D printer (specifically an AnyCubic Vyper)! I’ve honestly looked at 3D printers for years, but never been able to commit to the cost of purchasing one. This is also a great way to kick off a long over blog and certainly give me much to blog about, now to make time to keep track of what’s going on and what I’ve been up to.  Looking forward to adding prints as I go here.

<h2>New Year, New Blog!</h2>

Looks like Santa was extra special this year, and brought us a new gadget, a 3D printer (specifically an AnyCubic Vyper)! I’ve honestly looked at 3D printers for years, but never been able to commit to the cost of purchasing one. This is also a great way to kick off a long over blog and certainly give me much to blog about, now to make time to keep track of what’s going on and what I’ve been up to.  Looking forward to adding prints as I go here.

We will see how this goes!
